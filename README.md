## :books: Learning

  - Excellent explanation on how to manage the state of the application.
  - Use of reducer to update the store, which is nothing more than a huge Json to keep the last state of the application.
  - The difference between reducers and effects is that they will also react to an action but are executed asynchronously because they are based on observables.

## :small_orange_diamond: Sharing

  - I concluded that it will take many more hours of study to upload the concept of Angular to my 'core'. Then, don't worry if you are a little or very lost in this course. Keep digging and you will obtain success.
